### Technical Test for Senior Developer - Angular

#### Problem Description:

We are developing an e-commerce application with Angular. One of the key requirements is the ability to search for products in a catalog efficiently. To achieve this, we will implement a binary search to find specific products by their ID.

A repository with a predefined mock of products will be provided to facilitate development. This repository already has Jest and TailwindCSS installed, allowing the candidate to focus on adding the new feature.

#### Objective:

Implement a binary search function in Angular to find a product in a catalog ordered by IDs. The function must be efficient and should integrate properly with the rest of the Angular application.

If no product is found, a message "Product not found" should be displayed. If the ID is found, the product details should be displayed, all within the APP component.

#### Requirements:

**Search Component:**

- Create a component that allows the user to enter a product ID and display the details of the found product.

**Unit Tests:**

- Include unit tests for all created components or services, using Jest.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
